# British English Academy

Welcome to the **British English Academy** repository! This project showcases a structured English curriculum tailored for kindergarten (early years) through 10th grade. The aim is to provide clear, engaging, and sequential content that helps young learners build a strong foundation in British English grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, and speaking skills.

## Overview

This repository is organized into folders by grade level, from Kindergarten to 10th Grade. Each grade-level folder contains lesson outlines, activities, and suggested homework. Additionally, there are resources and assessment materials available to support each unit of study. The structure helps learners, parents, and educators navigate and find exactly what they need for each grade or skill area.

### Key Features

- **Supplementary Materials**: Worksheets, references, multimedia content, and assessments help reinforce core concepts.  
- **Flexible Structure**: Educators can mix and match lessons or use them sequentially for a comprehensive experience.  
- **Open for Contributions**: Feedback, edits, and lesson ideas are encouraged to keep the curriculum up-to-date and engaging.
